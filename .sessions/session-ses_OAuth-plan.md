## User

Lets start a new feature for this app.
Read @AGENTS.md to get context. For the added UI elements see figma design.
The feature is:
Add a login button ("Sign in with GitHub")
It should then start the OAuth flow so the user can login
After obtaining the auth token is should be stored in localStorage.
Add Session management (login / logout)
